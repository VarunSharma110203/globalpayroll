Payroll Standard Options & Universal Configurations
Overview
This document outlines standard payroll options and configurations that exist independent of country-specific rules. These are universal building blocks that can be combined to support any country's payroll requirements. Think of these as the "vocabulary" of payroll—the fundamental choices and configurations that transcend borders.

  "percentage": 6.2,
  "appliedTo": "gross_salary",
  "currency": "USD",
  "frequency": "every_payroll",
  "conditions": []
}

6. TAX CALCULATION METHODS: UNIVERSAL APPROACHES
6.1 Tax System Models
Model 1: Progressive/Marginal Tax System
How it works: Taxpayer moves through brackets, each increment of income taxed at progressively higher rates.
Characteristics:

Multiple tax brackets (typically 3-10)
Lower rates at lower incomes, higher rates at higher incomes
Only income within a bracket is taxed at that bracket's rate
Most common globally

Configuration Example:
json{
  "taxSystemType": "progressive_marginal",
  "brackets": [
    { "min": 0, "max": 10000, "rate": 0, "name": "tax_free_allowance" },
    { "min": 10000, "max": 50000, "rate": 20 },
    { "min": 50000, "max": 100000, "rate": 40 },
    { "min": 100000, "max": null, "rate": 45 }
  ],
  "calculationMethod": "marginal"
}
Example: US (2025)

10% on first $11,000
12% on next $33,725 (i.e., $11,000 to $44,725)
22% on next portion, etc.

Model 2: Slab/Bracket Tax System
How it works: Entire income taxed at single rate determined by which bracket it falls into.
Characteristics:

Income falls into a bracket, entire income taxed at that rate
Simpler than marginal but less progressive
Less common in developed nations

Configuration:
json{
  "taxSystemType": "slab_bracket",
  "brackets": [
    { "min": 0, "max": 20000, "rate": 0 },
    { "min": 20001, "max": 100000, "rate": 15 },
    { "min": 100001, "max": 500000, "rate": 25 },
    { "min": 500001, "max": null, "rate": 35 }
  ],
  "calculationMethod": "slab"
}
Model 3: Flat Tax System
How it works: Single tax rate applied to all income.
Characteristics:

Same rate regardless of income level
Very simple calculation
Considered regressive (lower earners pay proportionally more)
Used in Estonia, Latvia, and some others

Configuration:
json{
  "taxSystemType": "flat_tax",
  "rate": 20,
  "appliedTo": "taxable_income"
}
Model 4: Graduated Scale (Non-Marginal)
How it works: Similar to slab, but with graduated progression.
Characteristics:

Different from marginal: income falling in bracket taxed at that rate
Used in some countries for specific taxes

Configuration:
json{
  "taxSystemType": "graduated_scale",
  "brackets": [
    { "min": 0, "max": 50000, "rate": 5 },
    { "min": 50000, "max": 100000, "rate": 10 },
    { "min": 100000, "max": 250000, "rate": 15 }
  ]
}
Model 5: No Tax / Exempt
How it works: Income is not subject to tax.
Characteristics:

Used for specific earnings types (reimbursements, some benefits)
May have conditions (documented, reasonable, etc.)

Configuration:
json{
  "taxSystemType": "no_tax",
  "reason": "reimbursement_documented"
}

7. TAX CREDITS: UNIVERSAL TYPES
7.1 Pre-Tax Credits (Reduce Taxable Income)
Definition: Amounts subtracted from taxable income before tax rate applied.
Configuration:
json{
  "creditType": "pre_tax",
  "creditMethod": "income_reduction",
  "amount": 50000,
  "appliedBefore": "tax_brackets"
}
Standard Examples:

Personal exemption / Standard deduction
Dependent exemptions
Investment deductions (80C India)
Medical expense deductions
Education savings deductions

Advantages:

Uniform benefit (everyone gets same % benefit from deduction)
Simple to calculate
Progressive in effect (high earners don't benefit from capping)

Disadvantages:

Gives larger absolute benefit to high earners
May not help very low earners much

7.2 Post-Tax Credits (Reduce Final Tax)
Definition: Amounts subtracted from final tax amount.
Configuration:
json{
  "creditType": "post_tax",
  "creditMethod": "tax_reduction",
  "amount": 2000
}
Standard Examples:

Child tax credit
Earned income tax credit (EITC)
Education tax credit
Tax relief for dependents
Energy efficiency credits

Advantages:

Direct, predictable reduction in tax
Can be made refundable (government pays if credit exceeds tax)
Progressive (can help low earners more)

Disadvantages:

More complex to administer
Refundable credits have higher cost

7.3 Credit Properties
Refundable vs. Non-Refundable
Non-RefundableRefundableCan only reduce tax to zeroCan result in negative tax (refund)Employee doesn't get benefit if no tax owedEmployee receives difference as paymentExample: Child tax creditExample: EITCMore commonLess common, more expensive
Partial Refundability
json{
  "creditType": "post_tax",
  "amount": 2000,
  "refundability": "partial",
  "refundablePercentage": 15
}
Example: US Child Tax Credit is 15% refundable
7.4 Income Dependency
Definition: Credit amount changes based on income level.
Configuration:
json{
  "creditType": "post_tax",
  "baseAmount": 5000,
  "phaseOut": {
    "startIncome": 100000,
    "endIncome": 150000,
    "reduction": "linear"
  }
}
Example: EITC phases out as income increases
7.5 Family/Dependent Dependency
Definition: Credit amount based on family composition.
Configuration:
json{
  "creditType": "post_tax",
  "amountPerDependent": 2000,
  "maxDependents": 10,

  "maxMatchUpTo": {
    "percentage": 3,
    "of": "employee_contribution"
  },
  "appliedTo": "pension_contributions"
}
Examples: 401(k) matching (typically 50-100% of first 3-6%)

json{
  "employerDeductionType": "fixed_amount",
  "amount": 1000,
  "frequency": "monthly",
  "appliedTo": "retirement_fund"

json{
  "employerDeductionType": "percentage",
  "percentage": 20,
  "appliedTo": "gross_payroll",
  "capped": false,

json{
  "employerDeductionType": "percentage_with_cap",
  "percentage": 6.2,
  "appliedTo": "salary",
  "cap": {
    "annualEarningsCap": 168600,
    "type": "earnings_ceiling"
  }
}
Examples: US Social Security (6.2% up to $168,600)
